Identifier Names
==============

Since Fortran is not case sensitive, CamelCase naming is bad because
the names `CamelCase`, `Camelcase`, and `camelcase` are all identical
to the compiler. Therefore variable and function names should be named
all lower case using underscores, i.e. `an_example_variable`.
