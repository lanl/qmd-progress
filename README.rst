A library for quantum chemistry solvers
=======================================

**PROGRESS**: Parallel, Rapid **O(N)** and Graph-based Recursive Electronic
Structure Solver. **LA-CC-16-068**

- This library is focused on the development of general solvers that are
  commonly used in **quantum chemistry packages**.

- This library has to be compiled with the `Basic Matrix Library (BML)
  <https://basic-matrix-library.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

- Our webpage can be found at https://qmd-progress.readthedocs.io/

Build Dependencies
==================

- **>=OpenMP-3.1**
- **>=metis-5.0** if building with **PROGRESS_GRAPHLIB**

Note that on some distributions, metis is available as a package. Make sure you
install the **-dev** package. For example, Ubuntu requires **libmetis-dev**.

Testing in our CI container
===========================

We are switching our CI tests from Travis-CI to GitHub Actions because Travis-CI
is `limiting the number of builds for open source projects
<https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing>`_. Our workflow
uses a
`custom Docker image <https://hub.docker.com/r/nicolasbock/qmd-progress>`_ which
comes with the necessary compiler tool chain and a pre-installed `bml` library
to build and test the **qmd-progress** library. Using **docker** is a convenient
and quick way to develop, build, and test the **qmd-progress** library.

.. code-block:: console

    ./scripts/run-local-docker-container.sh

Inside the container:

.. code-block:: console

    ./build.sh compile

Alternatively, you can run one of the CI tests by executing e.g.

.. code-block:: console

    ./scripts/ci-with-graphlib-debug.sh

Build and Install Instructions
==============================

How to build
------------

.. code-block:: console

    CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<BML install path> ./build.sh

How to install
--------------

.. code-block:: console

    cd build
    sudo make install

To specify the Intel Fortran compiler:

.. code-block:: console

    FC=ifort PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<BML install path>/lib/pkgconfig ./build.sh

To build with the gfortran compiler and OpenMP:

.. code-block:: console

    CC=gcc FC=gfortran \
        CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        PROGRESS_OPENMP=yes \
        CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<BML install path> \
        CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PROGRESS install path> \
        ./build.sh configure

To build with OpenMP, MPI and testing enabled:

.. code-block:: console

    CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 \
        CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        PROGRESS_OPENMP=yes \
        PROGRESS_MPI=yes \
        PROGRESS_TESTING=yes \
        CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<BML install path> \
        CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PROGRESS install path> \
        ./build.sh configure

To build with OpenMP, MPI, testing enabled and example programs built:

.. code-block:: console

    CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 \
	    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
	    PROGRESS_OPENMP=yes \
	    PROGRESS_MPI=yes \

	    PROGRESS_EXAMPLES=yes \
	    CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<BML install path> \
	    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PROGRESS install path> \
	    ./build.sh configure

To build with OpenMP and MPI and testing enabled and example programs built
and the METIS graph partitioning library:

.. code-block:: console

    CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 \
	    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
	    PROGRESS_OPENMP=yes \
	    PROGRESS_MPI=yes \
	    PROGRESS_GRAPHLIB=yes \
	    PROGRESS_TESTING=yes \
	    PROGRESS_EXAMPLES=yes \
	    CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<BML install path> \
	    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PROGRESS install path> \
	    ./build.sh configure
