SP2 TENSOR CORE
======================


This example uses code from [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00057]. 
For a given test Hamiltonian, a density matrix is generated using the SP2 Fermi-operator expansion 
technique with Nvidia tensor cores.


# How to run

We offer two drivers for C++ and Fortran that call the Tensor core SP2 routine in PROGRESS.
